INT. DETECTIVE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

A dimly lit office filled with cigarette smoke. Rain streaks down the window, casting shadows through venetian blinds.

DETECTIVE JONES (40s, weathered face, loosened tie) sits behind a cluttered desk, studying a case file. A glass of whiskey sits untouched beside a flickering desk lamp.

The door CREAKS open. 

SARAH CHEN (30s, elegant dress, mysterious smile) enters, her silhouette framed by the hallway light.

SARAH
Detective Jones? I need your help.

Jones looks up, his eyes narrowing.

JONES
Lady, it's past midnight. Whatever trouble you're in can wait till morning.

SARAH
(stepping into the light)
I'm afraid morning might be too late.
